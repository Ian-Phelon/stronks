# Stronks

A new fitness tracker made for people that want to see numbers go up.

## Stronks Features

### 1. An intuitive interface for creating custom exercises.
   - If you insist on calling jumping-jacks "flippy flaps", now's your time to shine.

   - Flippy flaps work different muscle groups. They target your legs, and your upper & outer chest and arms.

   - Depending on if you go HAM, flippy flaps can be aerobic or anaerobic. Doing flippy flaps while holding bowling balls can be considered a strength exercise.

   - If you decide to actually do jumping jacks while holding bowling balls, set Resistence to the total weight of the bowling balls.

   - Bowling balls in specific are not included in the options for Equipment, however, weights are.

   - The notes section can be used to keep track of anything you want such as a list of ideas for re-naming flippy flap, or a reminder to purchase heavier bowling balls.

   - Or, none of this matters, and you just want to keep a count for one exercise by hitting the create exercise button.
  
### 2. Keep track of your exercises.
   - Count: Rack 'em up, pull out the mat,  .
  


#### 3. Planned for the future
 - [ ] Increasing your count automatically adds your exercise to a calander. See what exercises you did any day and how many reps. When this feature is released, exercises you've kept track of before release will be included.
